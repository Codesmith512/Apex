# APEX OS
The new bleeding-edge OS designed to surpass Windows, Linux, _and_ MacOS. Just kidding. This is just a project I work on in my spare time.

## General Info
This is a project I'm working on because it is my hobby, as such I'm currently maintaining exclusive control over the code base.

You are, however, encouraged to go through the source code and take a look around, whether or not it's just out of curiosity, figuring out how something *could* be implemented, or otherwise. Just know that the implementation of the STL is very sparse (maybe look at [libstdc++](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3), however the code there will be much more complex.)

Please use this code only as a single example of how a give concept _could_ be implemented. Your platform ~probably~ will differ. You have been warned.

Good Luck!
